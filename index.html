                <h3>What is Computer Science?</h3>
                <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems.
                    It is a broad field which includes everything from the algorithms that make up software to how software interacts
                    with hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer scientists use various mathematical algorithms, 
                    coding procedures, and their expert programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems.</p>

                <h3>Who is the father of the computer?</h3>
                <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/12/194612-050-6100BA16/Charles-Babbage.jpg" id="Charles">
                <p>Charles Babbage was considered to be the father of computing after his concept, and then later the invention of the Analytical Engine in 1837. 
                    The Analytical Engine contained an ALU (arithmetic logic unit), basic flow control, and integrated memory; hailed as the first general-purpose computer concept. Unfortunately,
                     because of funding issues, this computer was not built while Charles Babbage was alive.</p>

                <h3>What Careers does Computer Science Offer?</h3>
                <p>Computing jobs are among the highest paid today, and computer science professionals report high job satisfaction.
                     Most computer scientists hold at least a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field.</p>
                <p>Principal areas of study and careers within computer science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human-computer interaction, vision and graphics, 
                    numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics, and theory of computing.</p>

                <h3>What Skills do Computer Scientists Need?</h3>
                <p>Learning how to program and code is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design,
                     develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry
                     , scientific, and social contexts. And because computers solve problems to serve and enrich people, there is a significant human component to computer science. Due to the range and
                      complexity of the projects they take on, computer scientists depend on both technical
                     knowledge and essential skills like communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity.</p>
